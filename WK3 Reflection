This week we learned about functions & loops.
I took a new approach in taking notes by utilizing p5.js // feature instead of taking notes by hand and then following along with the lecture. 
In learning the lecture, I would follow along on how to learn on creating a new funciton, creating it's variables but including "this.[...]". Overall making it much easier since we just call for that variable instead.
Although It took a while to wrap my head around using it, I know I'll eventually get the flow of it. 
We also took a new approach by recreating these geometric art pieces, I chose wall drawing 391. Beause although it seemed simple I wanted to challenge myself again with the rotate functions.
It was quite frustrating at some points, I got a hang of it and was able to create 5 seperate rectangles all at 295 degrees. 
Although I'm till working on the last quadrant of the left set of squares, throwing myself at this whole angle thing is slowly making me more and more comfortable with the concept and application.
I hope to have a better understanding of the rotate feature, while trying to apply logic, math, proper sequencing of the code. 
Overall these lectures and classes so far have really pushed me past my limits and tested my understanding and creativity through application of the material. But these challenges only make me stronger!
