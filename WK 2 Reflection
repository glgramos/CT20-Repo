This week, I got more into the groove of things. I got my readings and videos done a lot earlier, so it gave me a lot more room to understand and sit with the material.
First with the readings, I was able to read Coding as a Creative medium's "When things go Wrong" portion.
This part showcased that even professors, teachers, and people that deal with coding also deal with off days; i.e. error code, program not working, etc.
In a way it made me relate to people who are more far along their coding journey than me. 
While also strengthening what professor Stern said during last week's Thursday class about the false narrative of people doing tutorials getting the code right the first try. 
The second reading, Processing Community Catalogue's "Making p5.js" portion really echoed something that I would read during CT 11 media perspectives. 
To the underlying themes of sexism, stereotypes, politics, arguements of accessiblity and the like. 
Another interesting thing being, attributing the abstract defiintion of "Oddkin" and other interpretations/attempts at translating or making it accessiblie in other languages
was a nice touch. Relating it to how technology should be truly fair & equal for everyone. 
Next we went over some videos regarding the Coding Train; going over various topics, shapes & drawing, color, and the repeat loops all of which going over essential skills in p5.js.
Overall this week was very informative, I have a better feel of the class, the materials, and p5.js.
