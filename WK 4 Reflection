This week we learned all about Blender. 
Overall, learning a new design platform was exciting. Getting a taste of a new medium to express myself creatively was something really exciting.
I did feel a little rusty regarding my coding, since Blender was utilized with a different coding language. There was a little bit of learning curve but I'm sure Lili and the professor are more than welcome to help.
But besides that, learning and making something by trying a new platform also proved to me that I still have that drive to learn and understand something I'm unfamilar with. 
Creating and coding some cubes and spheres and utilizing p5.js was a really cool experience. Although my code had plenty of typos, Lili worked closely with all of us to make sure we were all at the same pace.
It was also a really cool change of pace by having the TA lead an entire week of classes. The vibe was definitely different, but in a good and positive way.
I hope there are more classes like this, introducing something new and exciting, building/testing previous knowledge, and more fun coding projects.
W week.
