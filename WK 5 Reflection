This week took a very interesting turn. Unlike most professors, Professor Stern pivoted to implemented the feedback from last week's survey immediately for this week.
One of my biggest concerns, coming from a computer science background was how long we spent learning a coding language, roughly 3-4 weeks. Then again, the pacing was a semester and not a quarter, which in retrospect I understand.
Learning multiple coding languages all at once, from mainly p5.js, to html, to blender, then back to p5 and focusing only on p5 this week was a nice change of pace.
I wish more teachers and professors were more like this with feedback and change, so kudos to professor stern and Lily. 
But this week we focused more on the html side p5.js. 
It was a little bit overwhelming, but seeing the final product of working with text, shapes, and a focusing on applying concepts of a somewhat familiar coding language was a nice change of pace.
