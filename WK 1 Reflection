For my first week here in CT20, as expected of syllabus week: mostly ice breakers, getting to know the class  and getting into the flow of things. 
Prior to CT20, I was a computer science major. my experience was limited to some arduino, some niche coding languages but mostly c++.
Although my coding skills feel really rusty, the professor and the classroom environment for creative coding was honeslty one of the most exciting classes I've taken so far.
The readings for this class so far have been very interative and insightful: "Picked last" by professor Santos & "Introduction". 
Both allowed for a feel on what to expect for the class, including the second meeting or lecture. 
I really enjoyed this class since it incorporated two concepts that I really enjoy, self expression and struggle learning. 
For our second class we explored the p5js coding language and text editor.
Creating shapes with code was something very reminiscent of things I saw on social media of people creating whole artworks using desmos. 
I created a simple artwork of a favorite character of mine, playing around learning about fill(), push(), pop(), and most frustratingly rotate().
Althought I had to get outside help and was back in the grind of coding, this new way was refreshing since it applies skills from my highschool digital art class.
Playing around with the shapes, looking up youtube videos on how to rotate shapes, and finessing the code in order to get the desired outcome was something I found fun and rewarding.
